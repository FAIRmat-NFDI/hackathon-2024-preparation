# Part 1 - Introduction to the NOMAD software and repository

## Background

[NOMAD](https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab/){:target="_blank"} is an open-source, community-driven data infrastructure, focusing on materials science data. Originally built as a repository for data from DFT calculations, the NOMAD software can automatically extract data from the output of a large variety of simulation codes. We have presented and prepared several resources that can be visited after this Hackathon. You can find more information in the [Domain-specific NOMAD documentation page](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/docs/examples/overview.html).

The key advantages of the NOMAD schema are summed up in **FAIR**mat's core values:

- **F**indable: a wide selection of the extracted data is indexed in a database, powering a the search with highly customizable queries and modular search parameters.
- **A**ccessible: the same database specifies clear API and GUI protocols on how retrieve the _full_ data extracted.
- **I**nteroperable: we have a diverse team of experts who interface with various materials science communities, looking into harmonizing data representations and insights among them. Following the NOMAD standard also opens up the (meta)data to the "NOMAD apps" ecosystem. <!-- Repeated in Parsers intro -->
- **R**eproducible: data is not standalone, but has a history, a vision, a workflow behind it. Our schema aims to capture the full context necessary for understanding and even regenerating via metadata.
