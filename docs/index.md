# Developing parsers for FAIR computational data storage of spectroscopic simulations using the NOMAD-Simulations package

This documentation page will provide foundational knowledge for customizing NOMAD to fit the specific needs of your computational research project.

## Hackathon information and preparation

The FAIRmat Hackathon - FAIR Data Management of Spectroscopic Simulations, presented by FAIRmat Area C Computation, will take place from Wednesday, September 4, 2024 to Friday September 6, 2024. Check your email for the link if you have already registered, or register at the [Event Page](https://events.fairmat-nfdi.eu/event/25/){:target="_blank"}

To help facilitate discussions and provide prolonged assistance beyond the tutorial, we have created a [Hackathon FAIR spectra Sep2024 event channel](https://discord.gg/qgpHtPZwkt) in the NOMAD Discord server.
